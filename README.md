Hello there!

This is the space of filiopa's learning curve of python.v3
Apart from this, it is used as archiving projects of all kinds of possible interests she may find in every aspect of programming/coding, 
in order to have a permanent, easy-to-use and reachable library to come back to whenever necessary.

Have fun with the internet! :)
